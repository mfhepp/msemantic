# MSemantic is now hosted at [Github](https://github.com/semantium/MSemantic). #

MSemantic is an extension that generates RDFa annotation for your Magento Store based on the **GoodRelations Web Vocabulary** for E-Commerce.

GoodRelations is a standardized vocabulary for product, price, and company data that can (1) be embedded into existing static and dynamic Web pages and that (2) can be processed by other computers. This increases the visibility of your products and services in the latest generation of search engines (SEO), recommender systems, and other novel applications.


**Shop owners: Download the extension directly from Magento Connect:**
